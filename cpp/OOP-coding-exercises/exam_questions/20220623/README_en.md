# Geometric Shapes

## a) Base class for geometric shapes: `Shape` (5 points)

Write a class for geometric shapes. This class should be called Shape.
Data members

- `id_`: data member of type `size_t`.

### Member functions

- Constructor: Takes no parameters and sets the `id_` attribute of a `Shape` object. The first `Shape` object created should have ID 1. Each additional `Shape` object should have an ID that is 1 greater than that of the latest `Shape` object created.
- Copy constructor: Shall not copy the ID of the `Shape` object to be copied, but assign a new ID to the `Shape` object being created â€“ just like the constructor.
- Copy assignment operator: Shall not be available.
- `area`: Pure virtual, public member function without parameters and a return type of `double`. This member function is intended to return the area of a geometric shape.
- `print`: Public member function without return value and parameters. It prints the text `Shape with ID <ID> is <AREA> units large.\n`, where `<ID>` is replaced by the value of the data member `id_` and `<AREA>` is replaced by the return value of the member function `area`.
- Operator `+`: If two Shape objects are added with `+`, then the sum of the two respective areas shall be returned.

## b) Subclass `Rectangle` (2 points)

`Rectangle` is a subclass of `Shape`.

### Data members

- `width_`: Data member of type `double` which specifies the width of a rectangle.
- `length_`: Data member of type `double` which specifies the length of a rectangle.

### Member functions

- Constructor: Takes two parameters. Sets the  width_ data member to the value of the first parameter and the length_ data member to the value of the second parameter.
- Copy constructor: copies the values of the data members width_ and length_.
- Copy assignment operator: Shall not be available.
- `area`: Returns a rectangle's area which is *w &sdot; l*, where *w* and *l* represent a rectangle's width and length, respectively.
- `print`: This member function works like the print member function in the base class. The only difference is that the first word in the output is not `Shape` but `Rectangle`. Your classes must support polymorphism regarding the print member function. This means that calling the print member function on a pointer to a `Rectangle` object that is stored in a `Shape*` variable shall lead to printing according to the subclass' implementation of the `print` member function (and not to the base class' implementation).
